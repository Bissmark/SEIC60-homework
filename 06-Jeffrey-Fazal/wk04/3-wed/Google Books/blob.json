When the Knight Bus crashes through the darkness and screeches to a halt in front of him, it's the start of another far from ordinary year at Hogwarts for Harry Potter. Sirius Black, escaped mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort, is on the run - and they say he is coming after Harry. In his first ever Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves...

Amongst them was a little bee called Miss Bee. However, she never told anyone about her \"burning ambition\"3 to become a writer, not even Ms Shephard, her English teacher at Wyedean Comprehensive School. Ms Shephard was a great influence on young Joanne as \"she inspired trust\"4. Shephard's comments on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone \"meant more to [Joanne Rowling] than any newspaper reviews\"5. After finishing secondary school and her studies in French and Classics at Exeter University, Joanne Rowling started to work as a research asssistant at Amnesty International which was a \"very, very interesting place to work\"6, but at the same time a huge mistake, because Joanne Rowling admits that as a secretary she would be anybody's \"worst nightmare\"7. It was during a delayed train journey from Manchester to King's Cross Station in London, when she was obviously hit by magic. The story about a little orphan named Harry Potter, who has to live with his old-fashioned relatives and finds out that he is a wizard, came to her mind. And because she had no pen or notebook with her, she had to think it. So, Hogwarts - School of Witchcraft and Wizardry came to life in her imagination, and as she invented it, it \"felt like research\"8. \"It was a question of discovery why Harry was where he was, why his parents were dead\"9. At the end of the journey she knew \"it was going to be a seven-book series\"10. The next five years, while she moved to Portugal, got married, had a baby, got divorced and moved back to Britain, she continued writing the first book of the series Harry P",
