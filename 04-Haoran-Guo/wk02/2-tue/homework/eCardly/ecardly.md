<details><summary><strong>Hints</strong></summary><p>

### Body

* The `<body>` should have a background of the `background.jpg` provided for you in the images folder. The image should repeat only going left and right. The rest of the page should have a background of #d6d6d6.
    - Hint: define the background image repeating in only one direction AND the background color on the same line.

* The `<body>` has a default font of Helvetica with font size of 12px.

* Define a line height for the body of 1.7.  This gives every line of text .35 padding above and below it.

### Links (`<a>` tags)

* Links on the page should be red (#ff3300) and not be underlined.
