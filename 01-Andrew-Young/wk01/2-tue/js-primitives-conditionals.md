# JS Primitives & Conditionals

### Getting Started

1. Create two files `index.html` and `script.js`
1. Include `script.js` in `index.html` using a `<script>` tag
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser and open the console
1. After answering each section below, `git commit` your work
1. When you're finished push to your fork and file a Pull Request to the main homework repo

---

**Pro tip**: Comment out your solution to each section before moving on, so your console only has messages from the section you're currently working on.

### Section 1

Create a variable called `age` and assign it to your age (or any arbitrary number). Write a conditional that matches the following conditions:

  - if `age` is less than or equal 19, output `"You're still a teenager!"`

---

### Section 2
Create a variable called `a` and assign it a number. Write a conditional that matches the following conditions:

  - if a % 2 is equal to 0, output `"After running our calculations, the result is even"`
  - otherwise, output `"After running our calculations, the result is odd"`

---

### Section 3

Create a variable called `b` and assign it a random number between 0 and 100. Write a conditional that matches the following conditions:

  - if `b` is less than or equal to 25, output `"bottom quartile"`
  - if `b` is between 25 and/or equal to 50, output `"lower quartile"`
  - if `b` is between 50 and/or equal to 75, output `"upper quartile"`
  - if `b` is between 75 and/or equal to 100, output `"top quartile"`

### Section 4

_On the menu tonight: Steak, fruit salad, tofurkey, and pork chops._

Ask the user (use the [`prompt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) function) for their menu choice and assign it to a variable.  Write a conditional that matches the following conditions:

  - If a vegan can eat it, output `"This cuisine is vegan friendly."`
  - Otherwise, output `"Vegans beware!"`

For the sake of this exercise, Tofurkey is definitely vegan friendly.

**Hint**: Two identical strings are considered to be equal to each other.
