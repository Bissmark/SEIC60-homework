# Mortgage Calculator
# Calculate the monthly required payment given the other variables as input (look up the necessary variables)

# M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n â€“ 1].
# M = Total monthly payment.
# P = The total amount of your loan.
# I = Your interest rate, as a monthly percentage.
# I = root 12 for annual interest rate minus 1
# N = The total amount of months in your timeline for paying off your mortgage.
