<h1>Welcome to the U.S. Sanction List ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</h1>

<div class="intro">
    <p>The sanction list is a list of persons who are currently being sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the U.S. Treasury Department. Further info of the person is also included if their name is found on the OFAC's <strong>SDN List</strong>. </p>

    <p>When an image is not provided when a new entry of sanction is created, <strong>Google Custom Search JSON API</strong> is employed to look for the first result from Google image search. If such image is not satisfully, please feel free to provide an image manually. </p>

    <p>The country list shows the nationality of the sanctioned persons and the number of sanctioned persons by country. <strong>REST Countries API</strong> has been employed to get some basic information of each country such as its official country name in its native language and flag image. Statistics of each country produced by <strong>CIA World Factbook</strong> is also included when avaliable. </p>

    <p>When a sanctioned person is added to the sanciton list, their nationality will also be added to the country list if it is not on the list yet. Adding, editing or removing the information of any sanctioned person would also amend the country list according. The number of sactions of each country may change, and the country may even be removed from the list if none of the sanctioned persons belong to that country. </p>

    <p>Understood that countries may have alternative names. Hence a list of alternative names is added. When an user enter a new entry or edit an existing profile using  alternative country name, such name would be changed to the common used name provided that it can be looked up in the list of alternatives. </p>
